# Yotas
Oss's reward system

Yotas is an open source engagement awarding system. Open source contributors across the organisation are awarded for the effort and energy they put into the platform. Each interaction they have on GitHub will give them a certain number of Yotas which can be traded for goodies, mentoring, ebooks (etc...) in an OSS shop.
